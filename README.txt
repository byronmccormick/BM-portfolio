This is my Portfolio, a simple, single page responsive site template.

So I've been on a single page kick as of late, partly because I'm lazy, but
mostly because they kick ass for experimentation. In this case, Big Picture
makes heavy use of my (tentatively named and soon to be released) "scrollgress"
and "scrollwatch" jQuery plugins to pull off some interesting effects as you
scroll around the page.
